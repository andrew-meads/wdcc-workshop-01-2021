            <strong>Grace Brewster Murray Hopper</strong>, (December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was an American computer scientist
            and United States Navy rear admiral. One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer
            of computer programming who invented one of the first compiler related tools. She popularized the idea of machine-independent
            programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, an early high-level programming language still
            in use today.</p>

        <h2>Early life and education</h2>
        <p>Hopper was born in New York City. She was the eldest of three children. Her parents, Walter Fletcher Murray and Mary
            Campbell Van Horne, were of Scottish and Dutch descent, and attended West End Collegiate Church. Her great-grandfather,
            Alexander Wilson Russell, an admiral in the US Navy, fought in the Battle of Mobile Bay during the Civil War.</p>
        <p>Grace was very curious as a child; this was a lifelong trait. At the age of seven, she decided to determine how an
            alarm clock worked and dismantled seven alarm clocks before her mother realized what she was doing (she was then
            limited to one clock). For her preparatory school education, she attended the Hartridge School in Plainfield,
            New Jersey. Hopper was initially rejected for early admission to Vassar College at age 16 (her test scores in
            Latin were too low), but she was admitted the following year. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar in 1928
            with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics and earned her master's degree at Yale University in 1930.</p>

        <p>In 1934, she earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale under the direction of Øystein Ore. Her dissertation, New Types
            of Irreducibility Criteria, was published that same year. Hopper began teaching mathematics at Vassar in 1931,
            and was promoted to associate professor in 1941.</p>

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <h3>UNIVAC</h3>
        <p>In 1949, Hopper became an employee of the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation as a senior mathematician and joined
            the team developing the UNIVAC I. Hopper also served as UNIVAC director of Automatic Programming Development
            for Remington Rand. The UNIVAC was the first known large-scale electronic computer to be on the market in 1950,
            and was more competitive at processing information than the Mark I.</p>

        <p>When Hopper recommended the development a new programming language that would use entirely English words, she "was
            told very quickly that [she] couldn't do this because computers didn't understand English." Her idea was not
            accepted for 3 years, and she published her first paper on the subject, compilers, in 1952. In the early 1950s,
            the company was taken over by the Remington Rand corporation, and it was while she was working for them that
            her original compiler work was done. The program was known as the A compiler and its first version was A-0.</p>

        <p>In 1952 she had an operational link-loader, which at the time was referred to as a compiler. She later said that
            "Nobody believed that," and that she "had a running compiler and nobody would touch it. They told me computers
            could only do arithmetic." She goes on to say that her compiler "translated mathematical notation into machine
            code. Manipulating symbols was fine for mathematicians but it was no good for data processors who were not symbol
            manipulators. Very few people are really symbol manipulators. If they are they become professional mathematicians,
            not data processors. It’s much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols.
            So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate
            them into machine code. That was the beginning of COBOL, a computer language for data processors. I could say
            "Subtract income tax from pay" instead of trying to write that in octal code or using all kinds of symbols. COBOL
            is the major language used today in data processing.</p>

        <p>In 1954 Hopper was named the company's first director of automatic programming, and her department released some
            of the first compiler-based programming languages, including MATH-MATIC and FLOW-MATIC.</p>

        <h3>COBOL</h3>
        <p>In the spring of 1959, computer experts from industry and government were brought together in a two-day conference
            known as the Conference on Data Systems Languages (CODASYL). Hopper served as a technical consultant to the committee,
            and many of her former employees served on the short-term committee that defined the new language COBOL (an acronym
            for COmmon Business-Oriented Language). The new language extended Hopper's FLOW-MATIC language with some ideas
            from the IBM equivalent, COMTRAN. Hopper's belief that programs should be written in a language that was close
            to English (rather than in machine code or in languages close to machine code, such as assembly languages) was
            captured in the new business language, and COBOL went on to be the most ubiquitous business language to date.
            Among the members of the committee that worked on COBOL was Mount Holyoke College alumni Jean E. Sammet.</p>

        <p>From 1967 to 1977, Hopper served as the director of the Navy Programming Languages Group in the Navy's Office of
            Information Systems Planning and was promoted to the rank of captain in 1973. She developed validation software
            for COBOL and its compiler as part of a COBOL standardization program for the entire Navy.</p>
